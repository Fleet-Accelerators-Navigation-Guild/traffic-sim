# Build_1

Developed with Unreal Engine 5
=======
# Traffic Simulator

## Description
The current state of traffic simulation software often lacks the real-world complexity and dynamic environment that is necessary for accurate traffic management and urban planning studies. Our project aims to develop a robust 3D traffic simulator using Unreal Engine and C++. The application will be designed to create a comprehensive traffic environment to help in testing and optimizing various traffic management solutions. 
## Goals
To design and develop high-fidelity, scalable, and customizable traffic simulation software using Unreal Engine and C++ for urban planning studies and traffic management solution development.
### In Scope
- Using algorithm calculation for car routing and design
- x86_64 based computer architectures
- 3 dimensional structures and routing
### Out of Scope
- Live data pulled from the real world
- Fancy Animations, and texture loading
- Mobile platform compatibility
## Deliverables
- Traffic Simulation - Unreal Engine executable/elf file 
- Project Demo, including a custom scenario 
- Scenario Editor, to allow custom road design 
- Software Documentation 
- Source Code
- User Guide 
## Benefits
- The project will provide a customizable and robust tool for traffic management studies.  
- It will aid in the optimization of traffic solutions, potentially leading to improved traffic flow and reduced congestion in real-world applications. 
- It will provide free and editable software for the basis of additional road-based engineering projects.  
## Assumptions
- Users have access to a computer with minimum spec requirements 
- Users have access to required dependencies enumerated in the project 
- Users have a basic understanding of traffic simulation software 
## Risks
- Unreal Engine or C++ may release updates during the project that could require significant code changes. 
- Project team may encounter unforeseen technical issues during the software development phase. 
- Discontinued Support on major operating systems (Windows 10, 11) for Unreal Engine and other project dependencies
## Dependencies
- Unreal Engine 5.2 performs as expected (no bugs) 
## Constraints
- The software must run on x86_64 based computer architectures 
- The project must be completed within the allocated budget and time frame  
## Budget
Our expected man hour cost is 360 hours. Our total cost is 96,200 USD. Our man hour cost is 96,000. Our material cost is 200.
## Communication Plan
- Urgent issues or changes will be communicated immediately through email or phone calls as appropriate. 
- Aiming for weekly progress updates that will be shared with all (accessible) stakeholders via email. 
## Participants
- Jared Myers – Software Engineer 
- Matthew Shamray – Software Engineer
